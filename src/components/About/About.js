            <p>Hello World! I'm a creative front-end React developer who's passionate about building digital experiences that nurture community, inclusivity, and knowledge, seeking new challenges and teammates in the coding realm! After completing high school, I decided to hit the road and explore the world. I've traveled to more than 21 countries across Europe, Asia, and Southeast Asia. I'm a big fan of diving, skiing, downhill biking, and any kind of craziness. I know that my experience working closely with my coding & life partner Patricie has prepared me to work effectively and collaboratively with any team. It's been a wild ride, but now I'm proud to call myself a self-taught coding adept and firm believer in decentralized cryptocurrencies.
